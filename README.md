# SpaceX-Launch-Success-Prediction
The SpaceX launch success prediction project was the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course.
The goal of the project was to determine if the first stage booster of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would successfully land. 
This project utilized:
- Data collection from a CSV and Webscraping
- Data Wrangling - removing null values, and implementing one-hot encoding
- Performing exploratory data analysis using visualizations and SQL
- Performing interactive visual anayltics using Folium and Plotly Dash
- Performing predictive analysis using classification models
    - Logistic regression, K nearest neighbor, Support vector machine, and Decision Trees  
    
It was concluded that:
- All four machine learning models performed the same in terms of prediction accuracy
- The conditions to get the highest likelihood of a successful booster landing were
    - Launch from KSC LC 39A
    - Low payload weight
    - Go to the GEO, HEO, SSO, or ES L1 orbit
- Overtime the success rate of the booster landing has increased and will most likely continue to do so
